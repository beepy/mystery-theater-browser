# About Mystery Theater Browser

This site was created to provide a user-friendly way to browse and discover episodes of CBS Radio Mystery Theater, and to surface high-fidelity recordings when available.

## What Is Mystery Theater?

Mystery Theater was an hour-long radio program that ran from 1974 through 1982, thirty years after radio drama’s hayday. There were 1,399 original episodes. It was a revival of sorts for its creator, the prolific Himan Brown, who had created the similar ”Inner Sactum” radio program in 1941. Many of the same actors and writers from the 40s joined the production.

Thematically, it is similar to the television programs ”Alfred Hitchcock Presents” and ”The Twilight Zone,” with the occasional addition of westerns, historical drama, and adaptations of classic literature.

Interest in Mystery Theater has resurfaced here and there, with rebroadcasts by CBS radio in the late 1990s and by Public Radio in the early 2000’s. Many collectors have assembled recordings and catalogs of the episodes and many of these collections have been uploaded to the Internet Archive.

## Why This Site?

The wonderful Internet Archive does not provide a wonderful way to discover content. I wanted an ad-free, mobile-friendly way to browse the episodes, with descriptions and links directly to the audio.

There is [a complete collection of all episodes, without descriptions, on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/cbs_radio_mystery_theater), but the fidelity of the recordings varies. I wanted a way to provide superior recordings, which exist for many episodes, when they were available.
