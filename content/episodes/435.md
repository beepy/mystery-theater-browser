Immersed in a study of Beowulf, Dash becomes obsessed with the tale and soon finds himself suffering horrible nightmares. These nightmares lead him to come home one evening in blood-stained clothes and with no recollection of what he'd done. Martha Saxon seeks psychiatrist Frank Sherby's help with her husband's strange behavior. When carnage at a nearby animal shelter and a double homicide lead the police to the Saxon's home, they must do everything they can to evoke his memory and clear Dash's name.
