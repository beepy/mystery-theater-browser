Martha Saxon, whose husband Dash is working night and day on a new study of Beowulf, asks for psychiatrist Frank Sherby's help when Dash has nightmares about the epic story, suffers from amnesia, and comes home with dirty hands and bloody clothes. When police begin to investigate the carnage that took place in an animal shelter and the murder of two people during a storm, the evidence leads them to Dash who, if he did commit the crimes, can remember nothing about them.
