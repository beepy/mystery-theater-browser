Claude and Polly Baxter are delighted when they inherit Captain Doubloon's castle and the mysterious lake known as Dead Lake. However, their happiness turns to terror when they discover that the castle is inhabited by Professor Micah, a mad embryologist who is experimenting with giant Venus flytraps and birds. The real horror, though, is the creature that lives in Dead Lake, scaring not only the local residents but also its creator.
