Upon hearing of their inheritance, Claude and Polly Baxter are thrilled to be the proud new owners of Captain Doubloon's castle and its mysterious lake. Their pleasure turns to fear when they learn that the castle is home to Professor Micah, a demented embryologist crossing giant Venus flytraps with birds and their terror reaches fever pitch when they discover the creature that lives in Dead Lake.
