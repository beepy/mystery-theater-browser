Tom Reynolds is bored of his life and the rat race. He takes a vacation, without his wife and children, on a remote Caribbean island full of powerful magic. After a few days of introspection, a beautiful woman washes ashore, seemingly dead. But it's soon apparent that she's alive and that's about all that's apparent.
