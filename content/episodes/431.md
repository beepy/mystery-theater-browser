Dan Bowles, proud of his half-breed Indian anscestry but not one to brag about it, saves ranch owner Hale Chalmer's life. He is hired as ranch hand and falls in love with Chalmers' daughter, Mercy. They plan to get married until the ranch's foreman learns about Bowles' background and challenges the unarmed cowboy whose life is saved by Chalmers. When Chalmers discovers that Bowles is a half-breed, he himself tosses the cowboy a gun and orders him to shoot or be shot.
