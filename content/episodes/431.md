A proud "half-breed", Dan Bowles unwittingly saves the life of ranch owner Hale Chalmer. In gratitude, he is hired as a ranch hand and life becomes complicated when he falls in love with the boss's daughter. Despite their differences, the lovers make plans to get married but things come to a head when the foreman challenges the cowboy to a gun-fight because of his mixed heritage. Chalmers saves Dan's life only to throw him a gun when he learns that the man he has just saved is a half-breed.
