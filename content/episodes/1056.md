A British officer stationed in India lives in a house haunted by a ghost that plays bagpipes. His flirtatious fiance finds the situation intolerable and demands that he get rid of it. Manwhile, she enjoys the company of other men. The piper may be trying to warn him about his engagement to an unfaithful, obnoxious woman.
