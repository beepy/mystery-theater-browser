A college professor and his wife set out in New England to find a quiet town to which to retire so the professor can write a book. They find Sleepy Village tucked away in the woods along a country road. But before they can move in, they have to be screened by the locals who won't just let anybody in. They have to be in the right 'state of mind.'
