A radio equipment production unit executive finds an ancient crystal set designed by him at a yard sale. But when he operates it, it broadcasts the conversation of a man and a woman debating over the destiny of mankind. The woman begs for a single extra day granted to people and the executive resolves to go out and persuade people to see the error in their ways.
