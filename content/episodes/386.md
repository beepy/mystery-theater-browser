An ex-cop finds work as a messenger for local mobster. When he delivers the message, he is surprised to walk into a murder. The woman has a smoking gun in her hand, and a body on the floor. When he sees that he is a dead ringer for the woman's dead husband, he suspects that something fishy is going on.
