A law-enforcement investigator tries to shame his bowling obsessed brother-in-law into paying heed to his family. But he is as yet unaware that the man is prepared to take his obsession to far greater heights. One day, the brother-in-law vanishes in a bowling alley and the investigator discovers that he might still be there - but in an alternate plane of consciousness.
