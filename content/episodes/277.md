A well-to-do, discerning dealer in antiques has resigned himself to bachelorhood, unable to let go of his lost love, when he must suddenly take in a teenaged ward, uncultured but warm-hearted. Meanwhile, the police are investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders in which women have been garroted.
