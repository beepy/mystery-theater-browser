Molly Butler is found dead of Carbon Monoxide poisoning. The police think that it was either suicide or accidental. But Molly's best friend, Judith Kent, has other thoughts after she reads in Molly's diary that Silas Butler wrote a mystery story for his Creative Writing class about a murder using CO that was undetectable.
