Peter Perkins is a loser. He is sidelined at work and pestered at home. He seeks refuge in daydreams where he isn't criticized by any, but such is his capacity for losing that even they turn against him and he starts to lose control over reality and illusion. However, it is the change in his real life that makes this story intriguing.
