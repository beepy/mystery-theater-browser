Peter Perkins is ignored at work and henpecked at home. So, he creates daydreams where he is the hero. But he is such a loser that even in his daydreams, things won't go his way and soon he has trouble distinguishing between dream and reality. What happens to Peter in real life is what makes this story so interesting.
