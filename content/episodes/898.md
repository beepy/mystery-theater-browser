A recently married couple, Tim and Mary Lang return to their native island in the Phillipines to meet Tim's irate grandma intent on having Mary's grandpa Dondoc's head on the chopping block for killing her husband, Tali. She tries to persuade Tim to kill Dondoc by telling him that Tali's spirit will never rest at peace until Dondoc's head is buried alongside Tali's body. When Tim dissents, Tali's spirit blackmails by threatening to harm Mary's unborn baby.
