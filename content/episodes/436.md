After being paid a visit by a past love, Judge Justin Travers vows to help Muriel Parks as a lawyer. Despite her father donating huge amounts of money and real estate to the old folk's home, Mrs. Parks is being refused admittance due to the fact that she cannot raise the $500 fee. Troubled by an ailing heart, Judge Travers is determined to win this last case.
