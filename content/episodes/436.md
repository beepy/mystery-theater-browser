Judge Justin Travers, 78 and suffering from a failing heart, is visited in his New York apartment by Muriel Parks whom he courted years ago. Because she cannot raise the required $500, Mrs. Parks is having difficulty gaining admittance to a home for the elderly, despite the fact that her late father left the home much money and property. Judge Travers determines to help her as a lawyer rather than as a judge, although he knows it will be his last case.
