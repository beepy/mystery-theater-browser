A shopkeeper in New York is chosen to be the next 'Lahmed Vovnik.' An ancient Hebrew legend says the world exists, with all its evil, only because there are 36 people who are worthy of living. Without them, the world would end. Satan sets out to seduce and corrupt the newest member of this brotherhood.
