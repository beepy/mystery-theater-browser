A businessman struggling to hold on to his job is facing the biggest battles of his life, both in his career and in his marriage. As he prepares to fight, he finds his mind lapsing into visions of medieval battle and begins to imagine himself as a medieval knight preparing for war. Gradually Sir Kenneth seems to take over the man's life.
