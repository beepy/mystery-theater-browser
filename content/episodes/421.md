Time and again the United States' plan to become independent of foreign energy sources falls short as their partner; Energy Exploration, Inc.'s resources are sabotaged. Amory Mills, EEI's hotshot lawyer sets up an elaborate scheme to entrap a corrupt EEI executive suspected of selling out the company. The clock is ticking as he zeroes in on Clem Ferris and finally comes close to unmasking "The Ferret."
