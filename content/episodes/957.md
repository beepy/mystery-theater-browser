A grandfather clock is the central piece in this gruesome and morbid tale. A young couple from Pennsylvania pick up a grandfather clock at an estate sale to give to the local minister. What they do not know is that the malfunctioning time piece does more than tell time, it is actually a gateway to the demon world.
