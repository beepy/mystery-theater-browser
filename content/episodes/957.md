A young Pennsylvania couple purchase a grandfather clock at an estate sale for a minister. The clock repeatedly malfunctions. But telling time is this clock's secondary function. Its primary function is much more sinister. It is actually a gateway to Hell. This is a frightening tale of supernatural and demonic intrigue.
