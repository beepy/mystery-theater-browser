An explosion occurs in a departmental store, leaving an old lady badly wounded who is immediately taken to the emergency unit of a hospital. She is freaked out when she cannot find her granddaughter whom she just met after a decade. In the meantime a young lady is brought to the hospital after sustaining a severe head injury resulting in amnesia. Are the women related?
