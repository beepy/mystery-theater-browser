A washed up civil engineer, who believes he was cursed by a river god after a bridge collapse years ago, is given a second chance when his wife begs his old boss to take him back. The boss does, but insists that his son go along on a project in the jungle. What will happen to Junior when he hits on the engineer's wife?
