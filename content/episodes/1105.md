After being hired by a charitable institution, a woman is surprised when the offer is not only suddenly withdrawn, but she is accused of theft as well. In order to clear her name of a crime she did not commit, she seeks the aid of the local police. When they wash their hands off the case, she takes matters into her own hands and conducts her own investigation.
