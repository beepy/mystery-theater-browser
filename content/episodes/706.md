A visitor is haunted by a portrait of a woman in a green dress hanging in his friends home. He finds a reference to her in an escutcheon below a stained glass window in a nearby abandoned church. A visit to the former church sexton reveals an entry in the church's death records that points to a mysterious murder. The visitor is determined to solve the 80-year-old mystery!
