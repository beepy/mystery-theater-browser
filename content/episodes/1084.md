Luck allows a worldly traveler and an old maid whose life's ambition is to travel to Europe to cross paths. He encounters her years later, only to discover that she has lived the last few years under the thumb of her ill-mannered relatives. Moved to pity, he vows to assist her in reclaiming her life.
