An imaginary tale about the origin of the famous painting, the Mona Lisa. In 1498 Italy, Leonardo daVinci gets a request from a wealthy silk merchant to paint the merchant's wife. When daVinci alters the woman's persistent smile in his rendering, it results in a celebrated painting â€” much to the envy of the husband.
