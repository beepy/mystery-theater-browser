A lady doctor tries to treat an illegal immigrant who has been shot. After the patient dies, his body disappears. At first, the doctor suspects that this is a stunt to avoid immigration officials. However, the body really did vanish. Her curiosity leads her on an amazing journey of intrigue and self-discovery.
