Based on the Robert Louis Stevenson classic, this tale takes place in sixteenth century France and finds two friends running for their lives only to have one of them mortally wounded and the other to find refuge behind a great door. The man stumbles into the home of an insane nobleman. The Sire de Maletroit tries to force him to marry his wayward niece.
