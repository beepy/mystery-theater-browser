Hillary Cummings, on her way to work as a court stenographer, is kidnapped and taken to a country mansion where a U.S. government intelligence agent demands that she identify her ex-husband, Bob Christie, from among three spies posing as Bob. She ultimately agrees (the nation's security is involved), but there are two problems: Bob has undergone radical facial surgery and she hasn't seen him for twelve years. She has to question each one -- bringing back bad memories.
