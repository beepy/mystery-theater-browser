Psychoanalyst, Hans von Fodor, is reminded of the flight he and his wife made from Hungary 30 years ago by the stories and gifts of his patient Mary Roth. Shortly after their wedding, Hans and Lili von Fodor were forced to flee from their native Kispest and leave behind a precious wedding gift, 12 golden chalices, which they buried beneath a cherry tree. Mary now seems to be leading them on another fruitless search for the lost cups.
