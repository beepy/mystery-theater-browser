Rita Holland and Walter Powers accomplish a murder they have been planning for some time. They go to Rita's apartment and after she turns up the hi-fi to its loudest pitch, Walter shoots her husband, Dennis. Their explanation to the police is that Dennis was killed by a burglar trying to steal his valuable coin collection. The police begin a routine investigation, so routine that Walter, subject to hallucinations, starts believing they know he's guilty.
