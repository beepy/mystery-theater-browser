Robert Lewis, alias Nelson Potter, has left the widowed Mrs. Randol with a few of her thousands in his pocket. She seems not the least upset because Lewis made her forget her unhappiness. But her children are not acquiescent, demanding that he be put away for bigamy. When the identity of Lewis' next victim is ascertained, the police make elaborate plans to close in on him.
