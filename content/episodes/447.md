After being swindled out of her money, the widowed Mrs. Randol refused to take action against Robert Lewis, aka Nelson Potter despite her children egging her on. Her frustrated family finds satisfaction when the identity of his next victim is revealed, and the police set up a grand scheme to entrap the wily con man.
