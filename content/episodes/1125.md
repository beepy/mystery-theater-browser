This is the story of the life of Charles Guiteau, the arrogant assassin of President Garfield. The story recounts Giteau's deception of his wife, her wealthy uncle, and his employers, and his delusions of grandeur in getting Garfield electedâ€”culminating in his assassination of Garfield in a DC train station.
