An ancient myth comes alive for a woman who believes a log she saved from a fireplace keeps her son alive. Like the Greek goddess of centuries before, she finds that her son's life depends on the existence of a single tree bough. But when her son goes bad, will she have the courage to throw the bough back into the fire?
