A seemingly average accountant with an average job and average home and married to an average woman is actually having an affair with a call girl and deeply in debt because of gambling. The bookies are demanding payment and his world is ready to fall apart. A chance encounter on the highway seems to solve all his problems. He ends up enpaneled on a jury for a murder he committed.
