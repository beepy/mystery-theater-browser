A mediocre accountant leading a double life is romantically entangled with a prostitute and knee-deep in gambling debt outside his normal world. When the bookies come knocking at his door, his real life is threatened. He comes across the solution to his problems when he is asked to serve jury duty for a crime he actually committed!
