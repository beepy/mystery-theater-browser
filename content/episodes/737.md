A young voyager takes up a long journey lasting three years. His sweetheart back home falls for another man in his absence. But his subsequent return strokes her old passions much to the chagrin of her present beau who swears revenge. The traveller meanwhile is completely preoccupied with a decrepit, haunted mill.
