A quote from a Borges story says "Mirrors and copulation are abominable as they increase the number of men". The mysterious mirror takes a whole new form of terror in this Gothic tale of guilt and madness told by a young girl who enters into the service of a lord who will not allow mirrors in his manor. They force him to look at the face he once murdered - that of his wife.
