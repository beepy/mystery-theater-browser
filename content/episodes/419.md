It is said that the pool in which the Lady of the Mist waterfall cascades into reviles all who attempt to usurp the place of Meg Drayton, lady of the Manor. Her Brother Charles' first wife fell into the lake and was never seen again. Ten years later, he has returned with a young wife who plans to take over the manor. Enraged by their presumption, Meg concocts a scheme to fulfill the myth of the Lady of the Mist.
