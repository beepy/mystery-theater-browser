Legend has it that the pool in which the Lady of the Mist waterfall drops resents anyone who tries to take the place of Meg Drayton, lady of the Manor. Ten years ago her brother Charles' first wife fell into the pool and was sucked out of sight. Now Charles has returned with his second wife, much younger than he, with plans to take over the manor. Infuriated at the thought of being replaced, Meg makes plans to insure that the Lady of the Mist legend will not be broken.
