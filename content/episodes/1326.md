A couple in the middle of a much-needed vacation encounters a minor accident on the highway. They make a quick stop to the town of Downville for gas and a quick check-up. When the local mechanic informs them that the car needs major work that will take a few days to accomplish, the man begins to suspect something fishy is taking place.
