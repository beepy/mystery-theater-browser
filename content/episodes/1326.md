A stressed-out couple get in an auto accident while getting off the interstate. Thinking it's not very serious, they journey to the old-time town of Downville to get some gas. A mechanic examines their car and tells them the car needs major work and that they will be stuck in Downville for a few days. But when the mechanic takes way too long to fix their car, the man — who is a lawyer — starts thinking he should sue, which sets up a surprise ending.
