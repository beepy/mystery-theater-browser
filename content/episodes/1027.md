An elderly lady author, her niece, and her publisher's nephew are held captive in the author's secluded home by a pair of muslim extremists. The terrorists must wait for their people to retrieve them and they expect the residents to take care of them. In the meantime, armed with only their wits, the brave trio plots to escape.
