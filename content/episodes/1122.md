A terrifying experiment in thought photography. A college professor develops a device to photograph a person's thoughts. He tries to use it to help his friend whose wife suffers from depression after the stillbirth of her twins. She wants to know where her two stillborn children are. The experiment reveals subconscious knowledge and resolves their problem.
