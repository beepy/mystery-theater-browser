Ostentation has tragic consequences for a couple with modest means as they borrow a diamond necklace to show off at a party. They end up losing it and the husband is forced to take a huge loan from an evil financier. But a mere debt is not their salvation as murder, death by accident and suicide soon follow in its wake.
