A man's car breaks down in the desert and he encounters the ghost of an old man named Quetzal who shows him to the long lost Aztec Gold and instructs him to guard the Aztec's treasure from a being known as 'The Savage.' He can't convince anyone that he saw the ghost of the old man and everybody thinks he's insane.
