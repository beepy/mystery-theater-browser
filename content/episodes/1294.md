Strange three-eyed aliens, in control of major cities, finally get around to sending an agent to Parson's Corner to impose their rule. Mr. Gordon soon has the town under the alien's control and, along the way, falls in love with the local school teacher, Katherine, who exercises a certain control of her own.
