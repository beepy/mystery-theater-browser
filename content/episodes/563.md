If a brain transplant isn't enough, add two wifes and two men out to kill the patient. A state senator is about to undergo the world's first brain transplant. His wife and the body donor's wife are having second thoughts. Meanwhile, two corrupt contractors who did business with the Senator want the operation to fail.
