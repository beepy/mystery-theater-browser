A young girl held prisoner by the Nazis in Vichy France during WWII seems to be reliving the life of Joan of Arc. The woman is a 20th century Joan of Arc and the events that unfold parallel those of 500 years ago practically to the letter. A Nazi General is sure she is helping the Americans and French Underground and tries to break her.
