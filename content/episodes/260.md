Explorer and writer Trevor Constaine always gets what he wants and he wants his daughter to marry his guide and assistant. Unfortunately, both are married. Trevor isn't going to let a little thing like that get in the way. With the help of some shrunken heads and a mysterious clock that have the ability to kill, he puts things into order.
