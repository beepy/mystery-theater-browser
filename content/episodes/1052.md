A young couple on their honeymoon visit her uncle on a Carribean Island. They notice an old house on the property and after hearing that it is haunted, the young husband decides to explore it. He ends up in a bad way because of it. Anyone who spends a night in a house haunted by a 'shining ghost' goes insane.
