A manic-depressive artist is blessed with an angelic muse that inspires him to greatness. However, he falls into alcoholism in the wake of her absence. When he gets into a fight during one of his episodes, he is confined in a sanatorium and unwittingly discovers that his angel has been replaced by another.
