When Jake Alexander, who considers himself the world's top theatrical agent, meets Delphi Carr, in his eyes the world's most beautiful woman, he tries his best to become her agent. He would also like her to become his wife. But before he can achieve his first wish, she gets married and suggests that Jake take her actor husband, Deke Roberts, as a client. Jake agrees, only because it will provide him with more opportunities to murder Deke, or have someone else do it. Deke is murdered by being pushed in front of a train.
