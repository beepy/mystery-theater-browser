When Jake Alexander, the world's top agent first sets eyes on the beautiful Delphi Carr, he takes both a professional and personal interest in her. Before he can act out on either, she gets married and instead urges Jake to sign on her husband, actor Deke Roberts. Jake willingly agrees with the evil intention of murdering him.
