Mike Wilson, auto mechanic, does automotive work for a bum who philosophizes about wealth and claims to be Millionaire Stanford Spruce. Mike doesn't believe him, neither about who he is, nor about wealth not being all it's made out to be â€” not until he finds out that he's Spruce's only heir to a Billion Dollar empire.
