Colonel Royce returns to Texas from a visit to the Wyoming Territory, convinced he can drive cattle throught the desert and past Indians to the lush grasslands of the north. With the aid of his spirited daughter, Judith Ann, and a quiet mysterious Easterner, he embarks on his scheme to drive 2,500 longhorns 3,000 miles through hostile territory.
