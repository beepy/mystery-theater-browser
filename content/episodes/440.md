In the late 1860's, Col. Chambers gives $200,000 to his former officer and current president of a small bank in Texas, Wayne Prescott with the order to invest the funds in cattle. Prescott who is about to marry the sheriff's daughter has no intention of investing the money as he guards a terrible secret. What the others don't know is that he is a member of a marauding and murderous posse, the Gunnysack Gang.
