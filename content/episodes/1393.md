A metalurgist researches a mysterious powder that does incredible things to metal. The secret of how to use the dust rests with his old college professor who promises bad things will happen if he uses this ancient secret. Industrialists go to extreme measures to try and convince the anthropologist to reveal this valuable tribal formula.
