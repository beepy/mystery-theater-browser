A young, small time hood and former college football star who is down on his luck and desperate for cash tries to borrow from his rich uncle. When the uncle turns up dead, everyone thinks the boy killed him. At first, his mother does not believe he is innocent. But guilt over his childhood compels her to try to find the real killer.
