A young man fritters away his family fortune and the love of a fine woman in this Kafkaesque tale of lost love and redemption. He exchanges three days of life inside his handsome body with a demon-like creature from the deep. When the creature does not return with his body, he must go hunting for it. He finds more than his body.
