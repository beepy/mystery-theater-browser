A little copper statue of the 'Queen of Thieves' lures a crooked stockbroker, with a taste for playing the ponies, into a highly successful career as a thief and then tries to get him to commit murder. He finds his back against the wall when an investor demands the return of her investment. She promises to help him plot another crime to cover his previous thefts.
