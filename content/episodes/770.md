A small copper figurine of the Indian queen of thieves traps an deceitful and mischievous stockbroker into a dangerous but prosperous career as a robber and then tries to get him to commit a murder. When he tries to step back, his good fortune evaporates and an investor asks for her money back. But she aid him in executing another crime that might cover all his previous misdemeanours.
