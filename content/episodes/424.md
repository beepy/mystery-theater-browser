John Desmond, a co-director of the Sociological Advisory Institute, is a leading sociologist, well admired by his colleagues. Yet, year after year, he is passed over while the Parkhurst Medal is awarded to other sociologists: first to his co-workers and then even to a former student. One day Desmond is approached by a Mr. Strickland who promises him the next Parkhurst Medal if he falsifies his research and murders his superior. The price of fame? Death.
