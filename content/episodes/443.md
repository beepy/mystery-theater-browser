Ann Fairchild has always been the ugly duckling of the family. Her older and much more attractive sister, Eve, always managed to take possession of her toys and favorite clothes, and later, her boyfriends. Now Eve has come home, divorced from one of these men, and Ann, soon to be married, declares she will kill Eve if she tries to steal her husband-to-be, Hugh Denning. She also vows to kill Hugh if he falls for Eve's blandishments, which he soon does.
