In order to feed his family, Jean Valjean steals a loaf of bread and serves a 19-year prison sentence for his crime. After gaining his freedom, he falls into despair once he realizes that no one will have anything to do a convict like him. His fate changes when he encounters a Bishop who guides him on the right path.
