Several years after they parted ways, a pilot still keeps in touch with an old college flame. When her letters stop abruptly, he travels to Samoa and discovers that she is actually a princess and is set to marry another. The pair stumble into trouble when he smuggles her out of the country, much to the displeasure of her mother, and the island's deities.
