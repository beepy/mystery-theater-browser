A U.S. senator is dispatched to visit a small, third world country on a diplomatic mission. After visiting, he is knocked unconscious in a plane crash. When he awakens, he finds a primitive tribe willing to worship him as a god. All he has to do is perform a miracle and is expected to marry a local woman.
