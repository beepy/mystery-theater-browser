Friar Ambrosius and another young monk, Friar Romanus, of the order of St. Francis, are sent by their superior to the monastery in Berchtesgaden, high in the Bavarian Alps. There, Ambrosius meets and feels great pity for the beautiful Benedicta, despised by all because she is the hangman's daughter. Soon Ambrosius is also scorned by the populace, most of all by the son of the village's most powerful man who wants Benedicta for himself â€” not as a wife, but as a mistress.
