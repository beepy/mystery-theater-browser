With the intention of making an investment, the owner of a French Quarter restaurant entrusted the sum of $10,000 to a long-time friend and customer. When an unexpected twist of fate resulted in the manâ€™s death, the restaurateur is forced to hire a private eye to track down her money. The search takes him through the shadier side of New Orleans and all the way to New York City, only to find that what he was searching for had been underneath his nose all along.
