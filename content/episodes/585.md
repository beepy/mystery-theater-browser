The owner of a French Quarter restaurant hires a Private Eye to track down the $10,000 she gave to an old and long time customer to invest for her just before he died. As the title suggests, the detective's attitude is 'follow the money' and 'there is always a woman involved.' With these axioms in mind, his search takes him through the shadier side of New Orleans to New York City and back again, only to find his query right in front of him all along.
