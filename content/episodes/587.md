A man and his wife come across an old friend in a stroke of luck. They soon discover that not only has he changed his name, but he actually joined a devil-worshipping cult as well. Despite his religious inclinations, they soon pick-up their old friendship to the extent of even trusting him to babysit their newborn child!
