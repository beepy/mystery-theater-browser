The apparition of a dead producer Peter Truro returns to haunt the actor Jason Phillips through his television set. The ghost repeatedly asks him to murder his wife Claire. The irate Jason is forced to consult a medium and a psychiatrist but soon gives way to believing the apparition. He must utilize all his resources to save Claire every time Truro aggressively frames the circumstances.
