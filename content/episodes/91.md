Actor Jason Phillips can hardly believe that every time he turns on his television, the apparition of Peter Truro, a recently deceased producer, appears and suggests that Phillips kill his wife, Claire. After consulting a medium and a psychiatrist, Phillips is inclined to believe that Truro's ghost is real enough and he must use all his wiles to avoid killing Claire every time Truro sets up a situation to make it possible.
