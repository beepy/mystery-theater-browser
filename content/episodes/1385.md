A man claims to have reacquainted himself with an extraterrestrial being he first befriended as a child. The extraterrestrial portends doom for the human race because of pollution and war. This sensitively written, emotionally moving sci-fi tale tells of a boy whose extra-terrestrial childhood friend transforms his life. It also boasts some on-the-mark social commentary on the results of child abuse.
