A wealthy, lonely landowner confesses she killed her cousin with an antique Colt .44 when he confronted her over ownership of some land. Balllistics reports that the weapon has not been fired in decades. The sheriff, who carries a torch for her, attempts to find out who actually murdered the land-snatching cousin.
