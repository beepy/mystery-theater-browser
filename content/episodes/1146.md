Alexander's father, King Philip, embarrasses him and his mother by marrying a 17 year old girl, Cleopatra, which delays the war with Athens. But the marriage provides an opportunity for conspiracy. The Queen seeks revenge while Alexander is torn between the father he admires for his warrior prowess and the mother he loves. When his father is assassinated, he becomes King.
