A man who has lost his memory staggers into an Alaskan cabin occupied by two men during a blizzard. They befriend him and he soon earns a job as a police officer in the county. A year later, when he is called in to investigate some bones that were found, he comes to the chilling conclusion that he must have been the murderer.
