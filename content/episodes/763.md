A notorious gangster is found dead and a reporter is dispatched to Europe to dig up background on him for a biography. Not long after he arrives, he begins behaving oddly and irritating his editor. He's onto something very important. When he makes a startling revelation, he finds himself drawn into a bizarre underworld where the criminal isn't dead but he might soon be.
