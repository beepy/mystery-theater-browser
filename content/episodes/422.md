Many years have passed since Jessica Chapman and Clare Connor were roommates at Stapleton Academy. Jessica is surprised to find that Clare — once considered fairest of them all — has been scarred by an unhappy marriage and a disappointing relationship with her daughter. But it is the memory of the full-view gold-framed mirror, which she gave to Clare, that haunts Jessica, and she sets out to discover what part the mirror played in her friend's tragic life — and destruction.
