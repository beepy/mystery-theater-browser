Jessica Chapman and Clare Connor were once roommates at Stapleton Academy. Jessica is shocked to find that Clare who was once "fairest of them all" has been terribly scarred by a bleak marriage and a dysfunctional relationship with her child. However, what haunts her most is the memory of the golden mirror she gave her friend, and she embarks on a journey to discern what part it has played in the tragedy of Clare's life.
