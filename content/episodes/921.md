A former student of a teacher turned politician tries to save him from himself as he sells himself out in the world of politics. Meanwhile, an intrepid reporter feeds rumors that they are romantically linked while the media fuels a search for a woman dressed in gray who slapped a public figure. This is a morality play for politicians.
