In a freak accident, Sgt. John McCaffrey wakes up from an alcohol-induced stupor in the body of Gino Carpacci, a professional con man who has stolen a million dollars from the mafia. While John looks for a way to regain his identity and avoid death, Gino plans the perfect crime-- to take his brand new body, the money and run.
