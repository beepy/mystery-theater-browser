After losing his job, Sgt. John McCaffrey drowns his sorrows in booze. Through a supernatural accident, he wakes up in somebody else's body. Although he thinks like himself, he looks and speaks like Gino Carpacci, a double-crossing mobster who has stolen one million dollars from the crime syndicate. While John-turned-Gino tries to avoid death and regain his identity, Gino-tuned-John schemes to take the money and live free from mob entanglements.
