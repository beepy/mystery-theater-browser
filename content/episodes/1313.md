Ed Larsen has been having a recurring dream in which he is viciously attacked in his favorite bar by a faceless killer. Mark Howgate, a stranger to Ed, is having the same dream on the same nights. When the two men finally meet, they decide to act out the dream in order to find the faceless murderer and put an end to their nightmares. The real nightmare, however, is just beginning.
