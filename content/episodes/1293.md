Ray Vance, an undercover detective, is so successful in infiltrating Big Joe's East Side organization, he becomes heir apparent to Joe's operation. The new apartment, salary, and girlfriends reward Joe's talent in his new role. Suddently the dowdy lifestyle of a cop seems pretty dull in comparison.
