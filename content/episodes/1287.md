When Millicent Sanford broke off her engagement to corporate kingpin Roger Skipworth, she called him a pig. Not long afterwards, Roger is rushed to the hospital where an ailing heart valve is replaced with a porcine substitute. Roger begins to think there may have been something after all to Millicent's remark when he starts taking on the characteristics of a pig.
