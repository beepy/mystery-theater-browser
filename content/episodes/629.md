A cynical and bitter skeptic attends a sÃ©ance with his wife and his boss. Despite his aversion to things of the occult, he soon realizes that he is sensitive to the paranormal activities around him and actually has the power to manifest spirits into the physical plane. His so-called gift however comes with a terrible price.
