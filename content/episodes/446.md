Years into the future, a perfect society is born-- a society without fear, hate and all other negative emotions. Pandora seeks to inflict her sorrow on others and Mara's obsessive love for Willis and their baby threatens to destroy Paradise. This leads to Mara being sentenced to death, but at the last moment she is sent to the past where she begins to appreciate the life she had.
