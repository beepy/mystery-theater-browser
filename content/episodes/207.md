A man dies leaving his wife a sorely grieving widow. He finds he can contact her from the life beyond, and she promises to remember him always. He learns from an angel, though, that as long as he is remembered, she is stuck in the middle ground between Earth and the full afterlife. He then seeks to convince his wife to forget him â€” not an easy task.
