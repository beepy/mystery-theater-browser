Five hundred years in the future, man has eliminated violence and violent thoughts in society. A violent man is reprogrammed to have placid thoughts. But when they need violence to protect society, he is asked to return to violence in order to save the world from invasion. This man with a violent nature finds an outlet as Earth's sole defender against attacking aliens.
