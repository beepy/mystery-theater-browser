During the Civil War, two spies against the Confederacy work with different means towards the same end and against each other. One is posing as a British agent offering to sell arms in exchange for gold. The other is a beautiful actress with secret loyalties to the Union. They double cross others and each other trying to get one million dollars in Confederate gold.
