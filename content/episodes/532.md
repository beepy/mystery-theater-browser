Adam Duncan knows he loves Joyce Adams from the first moment he sets eyes on her at the off-off-broadway theater where they both work. So he proposes to her right away. When the newlyweds move to Hollywood for Joyce's first movie role, Adam meets her twin sister, Janice. Suddenly he realizes he really should have married Janice, the more serious of the twins and vows to make her his wife â€”even if it means that he has to kill Joyce first.
