This is a tale of sibling rivalry between two brothers who are haunted by cursed chairs. The younger brother is an immature, despicable lout who takes advantage of those around him. One evening, while the two of them relax in wing chairs, he tells his older brother that the chair he is sitting in has the power to kill and that he's used it.
