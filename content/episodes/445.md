A scientist working on the development of an invisibility serum believes he has finally found it and uses himself as a test subject. However, things don't go as planned when instead of making him invisible, it separates him from his shadow. Once unleashed his shadow goes on a homicidal rampage that causes his estranged wife to fear for his sanity.
