Harry Taylor gets out of prison, thirty years after being convicted of killing his wife. He sets out to find an old flame. Is his motive revenge for jilting him all those years ago and dooming him to a life with a woman he did not love, or is it to rekindle the flame. Jesse Craig's son-in-law wants to know before she is completely seduced.
