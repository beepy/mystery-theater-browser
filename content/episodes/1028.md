In 1803, a dumb general deeds the entire western United States to an obscure Indian tribe. One hundred and seventy-five years later, the only living member of that tribe wants to collect â€” and she has the only copy of the treaty that exists (signed on the back of a jacket) to back her up. A small time con man tries to cash in.
