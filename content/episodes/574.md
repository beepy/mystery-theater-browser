Chess seems the perfect foil for a sophisticated jewel thief. An insurance investigator looks into the theft of several diamonds and other jewels from a jeweler. A stolen emerald and a game of chess lead him to look into the lives of three supsects: an employee; a long time member at the jewelry store; and a fence. Every character in this story is a chess fan.
