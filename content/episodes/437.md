Instead of writing a suicide note to her husband and children, a distraught actress decides to tape record her reasons for wanting to kill herself as well as her last gasps. But, being an actress, she would like to exit amid general laughter. However, she soon discovers it to be rather difficult, even for an actress, to leave the world in such a manner.
