Patricia Ellicott plays a contemptuous, fallen-from-grace newspaper reporter assigned to cover a story on UFOs in the small town of Universe Hollow. She wants to re-establish her credibility by discrediting the people of Universe Hollow. But she's haunted by her own ghost and she must decide what she really wants.
