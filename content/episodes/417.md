While playing on an Antilles beach with his dog and a red Frisbee, Ben meets Nikki, a young girl with unusual intuition who lives in the stately Great House. As their friendship develops and the tragic story of her brother unfolds, Ben, who has just completed a three-year study of aborigines in Australia, becomes fascinated with Nikki's wild talent. However, even he is surprised by the lesson she learns from the red Frisbee.
