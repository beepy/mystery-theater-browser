While playing Frisbee with his dog on an Antilles beach, Ben comes across a young girl with an unusual gift. He becomes more entranced by Nikki's strange talent as she narrates her brother's tragic tale. Their bond deepens and he finds himself drawn to her, and the insights she learns from the red Frisbee.
