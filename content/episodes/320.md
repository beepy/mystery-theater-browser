After chancing upon a charming boutique in a quaint resort city in the Caribbean, an arrogant and self-absorbed couturier uses the designs she sees in the store and claims it as her own. Soon after, terrible misfortunes plague her and she learns first-hand what happens when you steal from the Devil himself.
