A woman, with the ghostly assistance of an actor long gone is inspired to write a full-length play  despite having no theatrical experience whatsoever.  When she tries to take full credit for the story, the real author’s spirit asserts himself and demands that her name be pulled from the marquee. On opening night, the woman reveals the identity of the true writer of the successful show.
