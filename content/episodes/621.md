A lady with no previous theatrical experience receives a brilliant play telepathically from an actor who has been dead for 50 years. When she tries to take full credit for the play, the real author asserts himself. She asks that her name be pulled from the marquis on opening night claiming that the spirit of the long dead actor is actually the writer.
