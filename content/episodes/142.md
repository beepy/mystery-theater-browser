Hans, desperate for money, asks his uncle for whom he works for some of his inheritance a little early. His uncle refuses, insults him, then tells him perhaps he'll put him in his will or perhaps not. He also reveals that his money is hidden, just in case Hans were to make an attempt on his life. Hans is angered and fantasizes about his Uncle Anatole's death.
