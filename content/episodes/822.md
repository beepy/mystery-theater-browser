A self-serving, womanizing, World War II combat pilot survivor uses up his nine lives by committing several deceptive acts â€” most notably deceiving good-natured lieutenant/nurse Lisa Wright who cared for him while he was in a coma. He keeps his wife on one side of the international dateline and his paramour on the other. Trouble arises when one crosses into the other hemisphere. Meanwhile, a malovent spirit pursues his soul.
