A high elevation riveter loses his sight in an accident. While he maintains his strength and physique through exercise, his emotional health is deteriorating. To make things worse, the construction site where he was working is within ear-shot of their apartment and he is reminded daily by the sound of the riveters. The local beat policemen are familiar with the citizens in their area and warn him and his wife about a murderer that is on the loose. The two shall, of course, meet.
