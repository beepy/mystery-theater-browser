A shy man marries an equally shy woman and they move into her home. She will not allow him to fix it up or alter it in any way, despite its decaying condition. He wants to be more extroverted and help others overcome their shyness. She wants to stay secluded. We are the voices of the wandering wind which moan for rest and rest can never find; Lo! As the wind is, so is mortal life; A moan, a sigh, a sob, a storm, a strife. From the Deva's Song by Sir Edwin Arnold.
