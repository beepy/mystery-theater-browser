After moving into their new home, a husband makes an attempt to remedy the dilapidated state of their abode. However, his shy and timid wife adamantly refuses, preferring to leave their ramshackle house as it is. As time passes, he desires to be free of his timorous ways and become more sociable while his wife stagnates in isolation.
