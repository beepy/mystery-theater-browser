A former detective becomes a drunken street bum after his wife leaves him. He drinks heavily and his self esteem spirals lower every day. Then he meets a nice woman on the commuter train who seems to instill him with faith in himself. Every time they meet she offers him a dollar or some change. Suddenly she stops showing up on the train. He starts dreaming she is urgently calling for him to help her, so he decides to employ some of his old skills to find out where she is and what has happened to her.
