Rocky Stark goes to jail on evidence that shows his gun killed petty criminal Johnny Mallory. Rocky didn't do it and his gun never left his side. But when the man who really did commit the crime gets killed with Rocky's gun, Rocky finds himself fighting to avoid the electric chair. His wife never loses faith in him and sets out to solve the murder.
