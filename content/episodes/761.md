While drilling for oil, a geologist stumbles onto an amazing archaeological find: a modern house that has been buried in rock for twelve billion years. In that home is a nine volume history of the world that goes beyond the current year (1998) and tells the future. But the nineth volume is missing and the geologist, obsessed with finding the missing volume, is running out of time.
