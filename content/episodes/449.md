Gay Armstrong, in need of cash, tries to sell her late mother's expensive pearl necklace but is told by a jeweler that the pearls are fake. When her stepfather offers her $15,000 for the fake necklace, Gay becomes suspicious. She doesn't want to hurt her stepfather, but she is not satisfied with his explanation that her mother has sold the real necklace to help pay some medical bills.
