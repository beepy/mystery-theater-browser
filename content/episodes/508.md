Richard Paradon has it all, looks, brains, charm, talent, and the ability to make money — or should I say the ability to bilk women out of theirs. Then he meets a woman he falls in love with at first sight. Can he put his past behind him to treat this woman right? She did promise to never leave him — even in death!
