In the year 3039, the Earth is running out of an energy source called Selco which it imports from another planet. That planet has cut off shipments. So an astronaut is dispatched to win over the queen of the planet and convince her to resume shipments. Sometimes the one who appears to have the upper hand is the one who needs help.
