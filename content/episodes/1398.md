An eccentric older woman acts as a mediator to a squabbling young neighbor couple, each of whom is convinced one is out to get the other. She hires a hitman to watch the couple and assure that if one kills the other, both end up dead. But is her mediating meant to make the couple's problems go away, or just make the couple go away?
