The sensational tale of a serial murderer is followed by a judge and his attendant. The killer seems to exclusively choose young women as his victims and leaves tantalizing notes next to their corpses. The erudite attendant tries to trace the style of writing that seems oddly familiar to her but the judge keeps aloof.
