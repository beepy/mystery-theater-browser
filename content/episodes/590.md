Billy (Chappie) Chapman, a six-foot, 260-pound defensive end, is cut from the football squad because he lacks the killer instinct. But when his wife is seriously injured in an auto accident and the medical bills start piling up, Chappie asks the coach for another chance. The coach gives him that chance, renames him 'The Chopper,' and tells him to go out on the field ready to chop down and kill the quarterback. Unfortunately, Chappie takes his coach — and screaming fans — literally.
