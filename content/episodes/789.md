A vagabond called Larry Millard is convicted of a murder he did not commit. He is embroiled in a diabolic scheme by businessman Glen Paxton who is going blind and covets Millard's eyes after the execution. But mysterious events start happening to Paxton after the success of his scheme, things he never planned for.
