A life of crime, even in the past, can get you into trouble. A former swindler winds up in custody for a crime he did not commit. He tries to walk on the straight and the narrow once he is free by working in an athletic club. But a club member takes a dislike to him and frames him for stealing a purse. Finally driven over the edge, he is prepared to risk prison again to avenge himself.
