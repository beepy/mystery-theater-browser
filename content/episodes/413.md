The sacred white elephant of Queen Victoria has gone missing and it's up to Inspector Blunt of the New York City police to solve the case. Following a lead, a force of one hundred men storm Barge Criswell's home only to discover that the main suspect is dead-- and that he has been dead for the last fifteen years!
