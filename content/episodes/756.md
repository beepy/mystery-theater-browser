A team of con artists scheme to swindle an elderly and rich widow who thinks her husband will come back to communicate with her from beyond the grave. They claim to be receiving messages from her dead husband and exploit the dead man's love of fishing and poetry to con her. You just know you're going to love a story with a character named Mrs. Buttwheezer.
